# `whatever_disentangler` is a brute-force legacy encodings decoder

* It is available as both a package (soon officially, let's hope so) and a self-hosted web service
* It supports as many encodings as Python itself: https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings

To see `whatever_disentangler` in action, please see [README.ipynb]([https://](https://github.com/kirisakow/whatever_disentangler/blob/main/README.ipynb))
